The wings, bodies, and legs, like those of moths, are covered with dustlike scales that come off when the animal is handled. <br>.
Unlike moths, butterflies are active during the day and are usually brightly coloured or strikingly patterned.<br> Perhaps the most distinctive physical<br> features of the butterfly are its club-tipped antennae and its habit of holding the wings vertically over the back when at rest. The lepidopteran life cycle has four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (imago). <br>
